Face Recognition Guide

	1- Run the first couple of cells to get the alligned Faces data set
	
	2- update the path so it points to the data set youâ€™ve created or the one we have already made 	for you,then run the preprocessing and dataloader creation cell
	
	3- Start training making sure you train for 100 epochs


	4- Then make the test data loader in the testing cell point to your specified data set to test on
	5- also make sure to update the threshold we fixed it at 0.26 but as the data changes the 	threshold should be changed for better results

	6-We also added a inference cell so you could infere using our pretrained model on your data 	set but make sure to run the specified cells[Sphereface2, Dataloader creation, Feature 	extractor backbone, update the evaluation]
